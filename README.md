Summerhack / The Lab
====================
Summerhack was a short and sweet demo I've written during the summer of 2005
for a random on-line competition. Mainly it was a showcase of the 3D engine I
was writing back then with the help of Michael Georgoulopoulos, and which was
hosted at: http://engfx3d.berlios.de (which has since gone off-line, see
archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20060210131739/http://engfx3d.berlios.de )

 - Demo code: John Tsiombikas (Nuclear)
 - 3D engine code: John Tsiombikas (Nuclear) and Michael Georgoulopoulos (Samurai)

Issues
------
Depends on some unspecified version of 3dengfx, which is currently hard to
get, build, and install prior to building this demo. I think it would be best to
pull all the pieces together into this repository at some point.
