Summerhack / The Lab
====================
Summerhack was a short and sweet demo I've written during the summer of 2005
for a random on-line competition. Mainly it was a showcase of the 3D engine I
was writing back then with the help of Michael Georgoulopoulos: 3dengfx, and which was
hosted at: http://engfx3d.berlios.de (which has since gone off-line, see
archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20060210131739/http://engfx3d.berlios.de ).
You can find the last version of 3dengfx at: https://github.com/jtsiomb/3dengfx
